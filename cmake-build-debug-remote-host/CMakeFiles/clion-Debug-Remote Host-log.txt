CMake Error at include/libtorch/share/cmake/Caffe2/Caffe2Targets.cmake:122 (message):
  The imported target "c10" references the file

  but this file does not exist.  Possible reasons include:

  * The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.

  * An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.

  * The installation package was faulty and contained

     "/tmp/tmp.zB8BHBXaKg/include/libtorch/share/cmake/Caffe2/Caffe2Targets.cmake"

  but not all the files it references.
